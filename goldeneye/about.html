                    <h3>My Life</h3>
                        <p>I am a 28 year old SoCal native who loves competitiveness, family, my significant other, animals, and anything to do with computers and space exploration. I am fortunate to have a smart, wonderful, beautiful, caring girlfriend, Ariel, who is currenty a 3rd year Med Student at MidWestern. My dog, Lana, is also a big part of my life and I do whatever I can to take care of both of my ladies.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>My appreciation of computers, science, and pushing the envelope has grealy increased since starting the LearningFuze bootcamp. The hours necessary to really understand and execute programs is insane. It shows how much hard work others have put into making our world easier, fun, and a better place. For that, I am greateful and look forward to being someone who will be apart of that. Learning coding and how to program properly is no joke and I am thankful to be here to learn it the right way. </p>
